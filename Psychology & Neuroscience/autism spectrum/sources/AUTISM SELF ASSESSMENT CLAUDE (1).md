## **5\. ADHD and Hormone/Cycle Tracking (For Those with Menstrual Cycles)**

Many women with ADHD report symptom fluctuations related to hormonal cycles. Track symptoms across your cycle:

### **Week before period (luteal phase)**

Rate symptoms 0 (not present) to 3 (severe):

*  Worsened focus and attention  
*  Increased emotional dysregulation  
*  Increased forgetfulness  
*  Increased overwhelm  
*  Decreased ability to use coping strategies  
*  Increased rejection sensitivity  
*  Increased impulsivity  
*  Increased fatigue affecting executive function

**Premenstrual Score:** \_\_/24

### **During period**

Rate symptoms 0 (not present) to 3 (severe):

*  Increased brain fog  
*  Decreased motivation  
*  Increased overwhelm  
*  Increased difficulty starting tasks  
*  Worsened working memory  
*  Increased emotional sensitivity

**Menstrual Score:** \_\_/18

### **Week after period (follicular phase)**

Rate symptoms 0 (not present) to 3 (severe):

*  Improved focus and concentration  
*  Increased energy and motivation  
*  Better emotional regulation  
*  Improved ability to organize and plan  
*  Better working memory  
*  Decreased impulsivity

**Follicular Score:** \_\_/18

### **Mid-cycle (ovulation)**

Rate symptoms 0 (not present) to 3 (severe):

*  Peak in energy and productivity  
*  Increased sociability  
*  Improved focus  
*  Decreased ADHD symptoms overall  
*  Improved executive function  
*  Increased creativity

**Ovulation Score:** \_\_/18

**Notes:** Higher scores in luteal and menstrual phases with lower scores in follicular and ovulation phases strongly suggest hormonal impacts on ADHD symptoms. This pattern is common in women with ADHD and may indicate a need for treatment adjustments throughout the month.
